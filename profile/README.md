We are a group of young computer engineers who in our spare time, enjoy gathering to discuss technology and building fun things with open-source hardware.

We have a passion for programming and delving into its fundamental principles. Over the past few years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence has led us to believe that technology will become more accessible, and more people will want to use these technologies to bring their ideas to life.

However, we have noticed that many current open-source products are not truly open. When we seek to understand the principles behind a product or conduct further research, these become barriers that are difficult to overcome. Thus, we came up with the idea of establishing Bit brick – to create completely open-source products. The name Bit brick comes from an ancient Chinese proverb “抛砖引玉”, which means to spark greater value through something simple. We hope that our simple inventions and designs will inspire boundless imagination in everyone.

Bit brick will openly share all design source files without reservation, allowing enthusiasts to explore every detail of product design through them and enjoy the fun of open source.

Let’s play together!
